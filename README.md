# Environmental Sensor Telemetry Data Analysis and Motion Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a project completed as part of the Machine Learning Certification Program. The project focuses on analyzing environmental sensor telemetry data collected from IoT devices, performing data wrangling, visualization, and building machine learning models to predict motion.

## Key Features

- **Data Wrangling and Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding sensor data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting univariate and multivariate analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful and insightful visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for motion prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises telemetry data from IoT devices measuring parameters such as temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, LPG, smoke, light, and motion. It spans a week and contains over 400,000 rows, providing a rich source for analysis and modeling.
